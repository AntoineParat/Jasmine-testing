# Project Details 

This "Feed Reader Testing" Project is a part of Udacity's "Front End Developer Nanodegree Program".
In this project i was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds, and i had to write test suites with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/), to ensure application runs well. 

## Installation

Clone or download, then browse the folder and open the index.html file

## How does it run ?

* This web-based application reads RSS feeds from different sources.
* By default, menu is hidden and "Udacity Blog" feed is displayed.
* Feel free to click on the menu icon to choose an other feed like "CSS  Tricks" or "HTML5 Rocks". 
* Clicking on the article's title that you would like to read will open the link to original feed provider.
